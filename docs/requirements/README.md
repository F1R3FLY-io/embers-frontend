### Feature Priority Matrix

| Feature           | Business Value | User Impact | Technical Complexity | Priority |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| Wallet Connection | High           | High        | Medium               | P0       |
| Agent Creation    | High           | High        | High                 | P0       |
| Agent Deployment  | High           | High        | High                 | P1       |
| Agent Monitoring  | Medium         | Medium      | High                 | P1       |

## Requirements Validation

### User Acceptance Testing

- **Wallet Operations**: Connect
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Create, edit, deploy, monitor agents
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network, validation, and user errors
- **Performance**: Response times, loading states, error recovery

### Business Validation Criteria

- **User Adoption**: 1000+ active wallet connections within 6 months
- **Agent Deployments**: 100+ successful deployments per month
- **User Retention**: 70%+ monthly active user retention
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second page loads, >95 Lighthouse score

### Compliance Validation

- **Security**: Private keys never transmitted, comprehensive input validation
- **Privacy**: GDPR compliance for user data handling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout platform
- **Performance**: Responsive design with 60fps interactions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Process

1. **Requirements Review**: Start each feature with requirements analysis
2. **User Story Mapping**: Break down epics into implementable user stories
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation**: Build features to meet defined requirements
5. **Validation**: Test implementations against acceptance criteria

### Code Implementation Patterns

```typescript
// Always validate requirements in implementation
interface CreateAgentRequirements {
  // US-001: User can create agents through web interface
  userCanAccessForm: boolean;
  formIncludesRequiredFields: boolean;
  systemValidatesCode: boolean;
  userReceivesConfirmation: boolean;
}

// Implement with requirements traceability
function CreateAgentForm() {
  // US-001 AC: Form includes agent name, description, and code
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "", // Required field per US-001
    description: "", // Optional field per US-001
    code: "", // Required field per US-001
  });

  // US-001 AC: System validates agent code syntax
  const validateCode = (code: string) => {
    // Implementation validates per acceptance criteria
  };

  // US-001 AC: User receives confirmation with agent ID
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    // Implementation provides confirmation per acceptance criteria
  };
}
```

### Testing Against Requirements

```typescript
// Test implementations against user stories
describe("US-001: Create AI Agent", () => {
  it("allows user to access agent creation form after authentication", () => {
    // Test AC: User can access agent creation form after wallet authentication
  });

  it("includes required form fields", () => {
    // Test AC: Form includes agent name, description, and configuration parameters
  });

  it("validates agent code syntax", () => {
    // Test AC: System validates agent code syntax and requirements
  });

  it("provides confirmation with agent ID", () => {
    // Test AC: User receives confirmation with agent ID and deployment options
  });
});
```

## Requirements Change Management
