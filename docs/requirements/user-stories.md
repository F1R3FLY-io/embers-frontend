- Form includes agent name, description, and configuration parameters
- Agent code can be uploaded via file picker or text input
- System validates agent code syntax and requirements
- Successfully created agents are saved to user's account
- User receives confirmation with agent ID and deployment options

### US-002: Deploy AI Agent

**As a** blockchain developer
**I want to** deploy my created AI agents to the blockchain
**So that** they can execute autonomously and interact with other contracts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can select agents from their created list
- Deployment process shows gas estimation and costs

### US-003: Edit AI Agent

**As a** blockchain developer
**I want to** modify existing AI agents before deployment
**So that** I can iterate and improve agent functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can access edit form for non-deployed agents
- All agent properties can be modified (name, description, code)
- Changes are validated before saving
- User can preview changes before confirming
- Version history is maintained for tracking changes
- Modified agents can be deployed as new versions

## Epic: Wallet Integration
