## üìù Notes for LLM Assistance

When working on Embers Platform tasks:

1. **Current Focus Areas:**
   - Wallet integration stability and error handling
   - Agent creation form validation and UX
   - API error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Key Technical Constraints:**
   - Must maintain type safety throughout
   - All wallet operations must be client-side secure
   - Performance budget: <1.5MB bundle size
   - Mobile-first responsive design required

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - New components need accompanying unit tests
   - Wallet operations require integration tests
   - All user flows need E2E test coverage

4. **Code Review Checklist:**
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - SCSS module usage (no global styles)
   - Accessibility attributes where needed
   - Performance considerations (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
